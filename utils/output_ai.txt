This resume has a good foundation but needs several improvements to be more impactful. Here's a detailed review:

**Strengths:**

* **Clear and Concise:** The resume is easy to read and understand.
* **Relevant Skills:** The skills listed are relevant for a software developer role.
* **Projects Included:**  Including projects is excellent; it demonstrates practical application of skills.
* **Experience Included:**  Even an internship is valuable experience to showcase.


**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:**

* **Contact Information:** The phone number is incomplete (+91-9876 is missing digits).  The LinkedIn and GitHub links should be checked to ensure they are correct and lead to active, professional profiles.
* **Objective Statement:**  The objective is generic.  Instead of stating a desire for a "challenging position,"  quantify achievements and tailor it to the specific job description.  For example,  "To leverage my full-stack development skills in a dynamic environment to contribute to the development of [mention a specific type of application or system, if possible] and improve [mention a specific metric, e.g., user experience, efficiency]."
* **Education:**  Specify the type of degree (B.Tech) and the university's location.  Adding GPA is optional and depends on the job and your GPA (8.2/10 is good, but consider removing it if it's below a 3.5/4.0 or if the job description doesn't mention GPA).
* **Technical Skills:**  This section needs more detail and specificity.  Instead of just listing technologies, briefly mention proficiency levels (e.g., "Proficient in Python," "Experienced with React," "Familiar with Node.js").  Consider grouping skills logically (e.g., Frontend, Backend, Databases). Also, consider adding any relevant frameworks/libraries beyond just React and Node.js.
* **Projects:**  Expand on the project descriptions.  Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to showcase accomplishments. Quantify achievements whenever possible (e.g., "Improved user engagement by 15%," "Reduced development time by 10%").  For the Task Tracker app, mention technologies used for backend (e.g., Express.js). For the Weather Forecast CLI, mention the API used.
* **Experience:**  The internship description is too brief. Use action verbs and quantify accomplishments. Instead of "Worked on React components," try "Developed and implemented 5 new React components for the dashboard redesign, resulting in a 20% improvement in user interface consistency."  Mention specific technologies used (e.g., testing framework).
* **Certifications:**  Good to include. However, consider only including certifications relevant to the target job.
* **Strengths:**  These are very generic.  Replace these with specific examples that demonstrate these strengths.  For example, instead of "Fast learner," say "Successfully learned and implemented React within one month during my internship."
* **Languages:** This section is fine, but could be omitted unless it's relevant to the specific job.
